# Scientific Theories of Time Travel

## Einstein's Relativity
Time dilation occurs at speeds approaching light speed. The faster you travel, the slower time passes for you relative to stationary observers.

## Wormholes
Theoretical bridges through spacetime that could connect distant points in space and time, potentially enabling instantaneous travel.

## Closed Timelike Curves
Mathematical solutions in general relativity that allow worldlines to loop back on themselves, theoretically permitting time loops.

## The Grandfather Paradox
What happens if you travel back and prevent your own existence? This paradox challenges our understanding of causality.
